📧 Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

This project is a simple machine learning application that detects whether a message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Logistic Regression. The dataset contains labeled messages, where spam is converted to 1 and ham to 0. The text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer, then split into training and testing data. The Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data, achieving around 95% accuracy depending on the dataset. This project demonstrates basic text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and classification using Python and Scikit-learn.

🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to solve a supervised learning problem classification. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and follows a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
The goal of this project is to train an ANN model that learns complex patterns from structured data and makes accurate predictions. The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Building ANN architecture

Compiling and training the model

Evaluating model performance

Making predictions on new data
